            <h2> How it all started:</h2>
            <ul> 
                <li class='line'> Bangladesh’s emergence as a sovereign nation-state came at the 
                    expense of millions of victims who perished during the
                Liberation War of 1971.</li>
            <li class='line'><u>Years before the war-</u>
            During     the Partition of India, Pakistan, as a 
            country, gained independence on August 14, 1947 following the end of
            British rule over South Asian countries.The Western zone was popularly (and for a period of time, also officially) called West Pakistan and the Eastern zone
            (modern-day Bangladesh) was called East Bengal and later, East Pakistan.</li>
            <li class='line'><u>discrimination-</u> Although East Pakistan had the largest population among all theprovinces, it had much less political power than West
            Pakistan.</li>
            <li class='line'><u>Economic exploitation-</u> East Pakistan was already economically disadvantaged at the time of Pakistan's creation yet this economic disparity only
            increased under Pakistani rule. Factors included not only the deliberate state discrimination in developmental policies
            but also the fact that the presence of the country's capital and more immigrant businessmen in the Western wing directed
            greater government allocations there. Due to low numbers of native businessmen in East Pakistan, substantial labour
            unrest and a tense political environment, there were also much lower foreign investments in the eastern wing. The
            Pakistani state's economic outlook was geared towards urban industry, which was not compatible with East Pakistan's
            mainly agrarian economy. </li>
            <li class='line'> <u>Language controversy-</u>In 1948, Mohammad Ali Jinnah declared in Dhaka, capital of East Pakistan, that "Urdu, and
                only Urdu," a language that
                was only spoken in the West by Muhajirs and in the East by Biharis, would be the sole official language for all of
                Pakistan, while Bangla was spoken by the majority of people. East Pakistan revolted and several students and
                civilians lost their lives on February 21, 1952. The day is revered in Bangladesh and in West Bengal as the Language Martyrs'
                Day. Bitter feelings among East Pakistanis never ceased to grow, especially with repeated arrivals of military rulers.
            </li>
            <li class='line'><u>Impact of the cyclone-</u> The already tense situation was further aggravated by a tropical cyclone that struck East Pakistan in 1970. It was a
            particularly devastating year as the deadliest cyclone on record—the Bhola cyclone—struck Bangladesh claiming nearly
            half a million lives. The apathy of West Pakistan leadership and its failure in responding quickly was a further
            platform for the Awami League, that capitalized on this tragedy. The Pakistan Army failed to do relief work of any
            significance to alleviate the problem, which further antagonized the already estranged Bengali populace.</li>
            <li class='line'><u>Miliraty-</u> Bengalis were under-represented in the Pakistan military. Officers of Bengali origin in the different wings of the armed
            forces made up just 5% of overall force</li>
            <li class='line'><u>Other factor-</u> In 1947 the Bengali Muslims had identified themselves with Pakistan's Islamic project but by the 1970s the people of
            East Pakistan had given priority to their Bengali ethnicity over their religious identity, desiring a society in
            accordance with Western principles such as secularism, democracy and socialism. Many Bengali Muslims strongly
            objected to the Islamist paradigm imposed by the Pakistani state. Most members of West Pakistan's ruling elite
            shared a vision of a liberal society</li>

            <h2> The War and genocide:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class='line'><u>Violence of 25<sup>th</sup> March- </u> On the night of 25<sup>th</sup> March 1971, Pakistan Army began a violent effort to suppress the Bengali opposition. In Bangladesh, and
                elsewhere, the Pakistani actions are referred to as genocide. Before carrying out these acts, all foreign journalists
                were systematically deported from Bangladesh. Bengali members of military services were disarmed. The operation was
                called "Operation Searchlight" by Pakistani Army and was carefully devised by several top-ranked army generals to "crush"
                Bengalis.</li>
                <li> <u>Genocide-</u> Officially,<strong> 3 million innocent people were killed & 200,000 or more women raped </strong>in erstwhile East Pakistan(Now Bangladesh) by the Pakistan army & religious militias in
                1971 in most horrific episode in human history.</li>
                <li><u>Killing of intellectuals-</u> During the war, the Pakistani Army and its local collaborators, carried out a systematic
                execution of the leading Bengali intellectuals. A number of professors from Dhaka University were killed during the
                first few days of the war. However, the most extreme cases of targeted killing of intellectuals took place
                during the last few days of the war. Professors, journalists, doctors, artists, engineers and writers were rounded up by
                the Pakistani Army and the Razakar militia in Dhaka, blindfolded, taken to torture cells and killed.</li>
            </ul>
        </article> 
        <article>
            <h2> End of war:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> The war between the Pakistan Army and the Bengali freedom fighters (Mukti Bahini) began. The head of the Mukti Bahini was
                General Muhammad Osmani. The Mukti Bahini were trained like guerillas. On the ground, three groups of Mukti Bahini and Indian forces fought the Pakistanis. The Pakistanis tried to fight back,
                but failed to resist them.</li>
                <li>On 16 December 1971, Chief Martial Law Administrator of East Pakistan and Commander of
                Pakistan Army forces located in East Pakistan signed the Instrument of Surrender. At the time of surrender only a few
                countries had provided diplomatic recognition to the new nation. Over 93,000 Pakistani troops surrendered to the Indian
                forces and Bangladesh Liberation forces, making it the largest surrender since World War II.</li>
